2. General
----------
Search and Kill (SnK) is written using C++11 and is intended to be used on 
NT-based Windows only. General compilation steps:

    1) Download sources from https://github.com/lcferrum/snk

    2) Compile it using makefile

3. Specific compiling instructions
----------------------------------
Current distribution only supports MinGW, MinGW-w64 and Clang. Though
compilation with MSVC is theoretically possible (no compiler-specific features
was used, just plain C++11), it wasn't tested. It is recommended to compile
using latest MinGW-w64 that can be installed through cygwin. The problem is
that MinGW-w64 uses MSVCRT.DLL version incompatible with NT4. If you want
resulting binaries to support this OS, you should use old versions MinGW or
Clang compilers (latest verions to support needed MSVCRT.DLL are 4.7.2 and
3.6.2 accordingly). Windows 9x and pre-NT4 versions are not supported in either
case.

When using MinGW-w64 from under cygwin, switch to SnK source directory and
type (for x86 build):

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86
    
Or, for x86-64 build:

    make BUILD=MinGW-w64 HOST=x86-64
    
To build x86 binaries with Clang 3.6.2 type the following:

    make BUILD=Clang_362 HOST=x86

This will compile both versions of SnK (windowless and normal). For other
compile options please check makefile itself.
